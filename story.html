			<h1>The <strong class="nuly">null</strong> And The <u class="nuly2">null</u></h1>
			<p>A <strong class="nuly">null</strong> was making fun of the <u class="nuly2">null</u> one day for <br> being so slow.<br>
			"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.<br>
			"<u id="nuly8">null</u>," replied the <u class="nuly2">null</u>, "but I get there <span id="nuly3"><strong>Null</strong></span>" than i think. I'll run you a race and prove it."<br>
			The <u class="nuly">null</u> was much <u id="nuly6">null</u> at the idea of running a race with the <u class="nuly2">null</u>,but for the fun of the thing he agreed.So the <u id="nuly9">null</u>, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled,<u id="nuly5">"null"</u>.<br>
			The <u class="nuly">null</u> was soon far out of sight, and to <br>make the <u class="nuly2">null</u> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <u class="nuly">null</u>.he went off the course to practice <u class="nuly4">null</u> hours until the <u class="nuly2">null</u> should.<br>catch up.<br>
			The <u class="nuly2">null</u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily,<br>and,after a time,passed the place where the <u class="nuly">null</u> was <u class="nuly4">null</u>.The <u class="nuly2">null</u> was so caught up in <u class="nuly4">null</u> was near the <br> goal.The <u class="nuly">null</u> now ran his swiftest,but he could <br> not overtake the null in time.
